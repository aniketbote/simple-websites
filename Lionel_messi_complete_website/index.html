<h2><b>Lionel Messi’s Success Lessons</b></h2>
<p class="grey">
Like most extraordinary people, Lionel Messi’s remarkable success did not come from pure luck or accident. In fact, he worked extremely hard and trained almost every single day to become who he is today.
</p>
<h3>1. Fight For What You Believe In</h3>
<p class="grey">
If you have a dream, you have to work hard to achieve it. Success will not come easy. There’s a price to pay and you must be willing to pay it.
Most people are not successful because they are not willing to do what it takes to produce the extraordinary results.
The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is the little ‘extra’. Extra means you must do more; go the extra mile, put in more effort, wake up earlier and stay later to produce more for what you truly desire to achieve in life.
<em><b>“You have to fight to reach your dream. You have to sacrifice and work hard for it.” – Lionel Messi</b></em>
</p>
<h3>2. Don’t Forget What’s Most Important to You</h3>
<p class="grey">
Sometimes we over obsess with something, and we neglect other more important things in life. I have seen people who chase money and they start to completely ignore their family members.
Never let this happen to you. Yes, winning is important, but you cannot win all the time and winning is not the only thing you have in life.
Always be grateful for what you have and appreciate those who are around you.
<b><em>“There are more important things in life than winning or losing a game.” – Lionel Messi</em></b>
</p>
<h3>3. Remember That It’s Not All About You</h3>
<p class="grey">
Always focus on winning as a team, instead of it being a one man show. Elon Musk, the guy behind Tesla, said this, “I don’t create companies for the sake of creating companies, but to get things done.”
You are in a team, regardless of whether you are in business or in sports, so work as a team.
Put your main priority on your team’s objectives rather than your own personal mission. This is how your team can grow and move forward.
<b><em>“When the year starts the objective is to win it all with the team, personal records are secondary.” – Lionel Messi</em></b>
